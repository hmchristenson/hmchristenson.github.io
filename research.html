        <p> My research interests include reionization, high redshift galaxies, and the intergalactic medium. I am currently working with George Becker at UCR on understanding the evolution of the intergalactic medium at the epoch of reionization, particularly the source of large-scale fluctuations of its opacity to Lyman alpha photons.</p>
        
        <p>My past research appointments have included REUs at Rutgers University (2015 with Prof. Eric Gawiser) and the Maria Mitchell Observatory (2016 with Dr. Regina Jorgenson) and undergraduate research with Prof. Kristen Larson at Western Washington University. I have experience with integral field spectroscopy, photometric surveys, and quantifying nonlinear sources of uncertainty.</p>

        <!--<p>interstellar dust, Lyman Alpha emitters, and damped Lyman Alpha systems. Generally, I'm interested in observational astronomy, including uncertainty analysis, the handling and analysis of large datasets, and improving my coding skills!</p>

<p>I spent summer 2016 at an REU internship at the Maria Mitchell Observatory working with Dr. Regina Jorgenson to search for damped Lyman Alpha systems using integral field spectroscopic data from the OSIRIS spectrograph at Keck. A  </p>

<p>In the summer of 2015, I participated in an REU at Rutgers University and continue to work with Prof. Eric Gawiser remotely. We are working on cataloguing Lyman Alpha emitting galaxies at redshift z=3.1 in the MUSYC1030+05 field. I presented our preliminary results at the winter 2016 AAS meeting. </p>

<p>At WWU, I work with Prof. Kristen Larson on quantifying uncertainty in the extinction-to-reddening ratio in the near-infrared due to uncertainty in the spectral type of main-sequence background stars. I presented our findings at the winter 2015 AAS meeting and a paper on our work is currently under review. </p>-->
